# deform\_conv2d\_onnx\_exporter

## Taken from [deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter](https://github.com/masamitsu-murase/deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter)

## Overview

This module enables you to export `deform_conv2d` to ONNX in PyTorch.

At this moment, in August 2021, PyTorch 1.9.0 and torchvision 0.10.0 does not support exporting `deform_conv2d` into ONNX, so I implemented this module.

This module implements Deformable Convolution v2, described in a paper, `Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168>`, using ONNX operators.  
The implementation is straightforward, but may not be efficient.

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter
```

## Usage

```python
import torch.onnx
from torchvision.ops.deform_conv import DeformConv2d
import deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter

deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter.register_deform_conv2d_onnx_op()

model = DeformConv2d(...)
input_names = ["input", "offset"]
output_names = ["output"]
input_params = (
    torch.rand([1, x, x, x]),  # input
    torch.randn([1, x, x, x]), # offset
)
torch.onnx.export(model,
                  input_params,
                  "output.onnx",
                  input_names=input_names,
                  output_names=output_names,
                  opset_version=12)
```

Note that you have to set `opset_version` to `12` or later.

## Tests

1. Install dependent libraries.  
   ```sh
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run `unittest`.  
   ```sh
   $ python -m unittest discover -s tests
   ```

## Development notes

### Options for `deform_conv2d_onnx_exporter.register_deform_conv2d_onnx_op()`

You can specify 2 options for this function.

* `use_gathernd`:  
  If `True`, use `GatherND` operator. Otherwise, use `GatherElements` operator.
* `enable_openvino_patch`:  
  If `True`, enable patch for OpenVINO.

### Referenced paper

This module implements Deformable Convolution v2, described in a paper, "[Deformable ConvNets v2: More Deformable, Better Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11168)", using ONNX operators.

Some of the variable names in the module, such as `p` and `p_0`, are based on the paper.

### Memory layout of `offset`

The detail of `deform_conv2d` implementation in PyTorch is not fully documented.  
Therefore, I investigated the [implementation](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/19ad0bbc5e26504a501b9be3f0345381d6ba1efc/torchvision/csrc/ops/cpu/deform_conv2d_kernel.cpp) to understand memory layout of some variables, such as `offset`.

* `offset`  
  The shape is `(batch, 2 * group * kernel_h * kernel_w, out_h, out_w)` according to the [reference](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/ops.html#torchvision.ops.deform_conv2d).  
  The internal memory layout of `2 * group * kernel_h * kernel_w` is not clear.  
  According to the source code, it seems to be `(batch, group, kernel_h, kernel_w, 2, out_h, out_w)`.  
  The size `2` means "y-coords and x-coords".

### Padding of `input`

Even if `padding` is set to `0`, this module adds at least 1 padding internally.  
This is necessary to handle out-of-bounds `offset` appropriately.

### Performance

To be honest, the performance is not so good because the current version of ONNX, version 15, does not support `deform_conv2d` natively.  
Therefore, this module implements it using `GatherND` and other operators.  
As a result, the performance is not so good, but good enough for me.

Of course, I implemented this module carefully to reduce unnecessary or duplicated calculations.

### Opset version

Version **12** or later is required because of the following reasons:

- `Clip`:  
  Version 12 and later supports `Clip` operaetor for `tensor(int64)`. This module uses it.
- `GatherND`:  
  Versoin 12 and later supports `GatherND` operator with `batch_dims` attribute. This module also uses it.
